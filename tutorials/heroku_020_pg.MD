# Overview  
In this tutorial, you will create an application on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database.  
The focus will be on getting the database setup in Heroku and connecting to it from your local machine using the Heroku CLI.  
In a future tutorial, we will implement an application using a back end PostgreSQL database.  

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub account / Git installation
- Heroku account  

### High Level Steps ###
1. Setup the Environment
   - Install Heroku CLI
   - Install PostgreSQL Client

2. Create a GitHub Repository / Deploy to Heroku 
   - Clone the repository to your client  
   - Add remote connection to Heroku

3. Client Connection to PostgreSQL / Database Commands  

# Setup Environment  
You will need to install the following:  
- Heroku CLI
- PostgreSQL Client  

### Install Heroku CLI ###  
It is recommended that you go through the following Heroku tutorial:  
[Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)  

The tutorial contains a "Set up" section with instructions to install the Heroku CLI.  

**Notes:**  
- You will learn a lot about deploying an app to Heroku  
- Out main goal is to install the Heroku CLI.  
  - Install the client on your platform per the instructions in the "Set up" sections  
  - If you don't run through the entire tutorial, at least read the steps
  - Skip the "Provision a database" section.  As of November 28, 2022 free Heroku Postgres is no longer available  
- Windows User Account Control - If your application will not load due to Windows UAC, you can install it as follows:
  - Lanuch "command prompt" as an Administrator
  - Install from the command prompt: e.g. *yourpath>heroku-x64.exe*

### Install PostgreSQL Client ###
See the following link at the Heroku website for PostgreSQL client installation:  
[Heroku - PostgreSQL Local Setup](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup)  

Below is a link to download and install PostgreSQL:  
[PostgreSQL Database Download](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)  

**Notes:**  
- Download the latest version for your platform  
- Install the following:
  - Command Line Tools (mandatory)
  - pgAdmin
  - Stack Builder
  - Optional: Database Server (only if you want a local database server)  
    - The objective is to install the client and connect to a cloud based database  
  
 **IMPORTANT Note:**
 - Make sure to add the **/bin** directory to your path
  
 # Create a GitHub Repository / Deploy to Heroku  
 We are going to emulate the steps to create an application, starting with a GitHub repository.  
 
 **Note:**
 We can create an application or just a database on Heroku and skip GitHub altogether.  However, steps shown here are emulating the process of using GitHub for source control.  
 
 1. Create a repository in GitHub, e.g. **herokupg**  
     - Select "Add .gitignore" and select the **Node** template  

 2. Local Machine: Launch VSCode and clone the repository (you should be familiar with these steps already)  
    - Click on "Source Control"  (left vertical bar icon)  
    - Click "Clone Repository"  
    - Click "Clone from GitHub"
    - Enter repository name (or search)
    - Enter local folder name
    - Open folder
    - Open integrated terminal  

 3.  Heroku  
     Create a new application (your last name followed by "herokupg"), e.g.: **asherherokupg**  
     1. Deploy the repository created above from GitHub  
     **Note:**  
     **Build will fail** - We don't have an app yet.  It's OK, the goal is to experiment with PostgreSQL 
     2.  Click on the application **Resources** tab  
         --> Click the "Find more add-ons" button  
         ![Heroku Add-ons](images/heroku_020_pg_addons.PNG)  
     3. In the Heroku Add-ons screen, click on "Data Stores" on the left
        --> Click on Crunchy Bridge (Postgres Database).  
        ![Heroku Add-ons](images/heroku_020_pg_addonsCruchy.PNG)  
     4. Click on "Install Crunch Bridge"  
        ![Heroku Add-ons](images/heroku_020_pg_addonsInstallCruchy.PNG)  
     5. Select the following:
        - Add-on plan: Test-Free  
        - App to provision to:  Name of your app (name will appear on the screen)  
        --> Click "Submit Order Form"  
        ![Heroku Add-ons](images/heroku_020_pg_addonsSubmitOrder.PNG)
     6. The Heroku Postgres add-on will be created  
        Click on the "Dev Center" link to learn more about the add-on    
         ![Heroku Add-ons](images/heroku_020_pg_addonsCreated.PNG)   
     7. View Only (images omitted): Click on the "Cruchy Bridge" link in the Add-ons section  
        --> Click on the NAME link (view information about your database)  
        --> Click "Connection" option (top menu selection)  
        - Select:  
          Role: postgres  
          Format: psql  
          Copy the connection string and save it in a temp file: psql postgres://application:...
     8. Return to Heroku - View Application Settings
        - Go to the Dashboard  
        - Click on your application  
        - Click on the **Settings** tab  
          Note the following (copy and save it for later use):  
          Heroku git URL: https://git.heroku.com/yourAppName.git  

          **Config Vars** Section  
          - Click on Reveal Config Vars  
            Note the following:  
            - CRUNCHY_CLUSTER_ID
            - CRUNCHY_DATABASE_URL  
              Note:  This is the same as the connection string you copied above (Cruch connection)  
        
 4. Local Machine  
    Issue the following at the Terminal (from VS Code, open integrated terminal)
    1. ```heroku login```  
       Launch the browser and log in.
    2. ```heroku config```  
       You will get an error that the application is missing.  
       First solution is to enter the application name.  Next is to add the Heroku remote Git path.  
    3. ```heroku config --app asherherokupg``` (use your app name)  
       You will see the application variables: CRUNCHY_CLUSTER_ID AND CRUNCHY_DATABASE_URL (same as the settings you saw in Heroku, Reveal Config Vars)  
    4. Add the remote "Heroku git URL" to your local environment  
       ```heroku git:remote -a yourHerokuAppName```  (Use your app name from above)  
    5. ```heroku config```  
       Note: since you added the application's git URL, it is the default application for Heroku CLI commands, and you do not need to use the --app parameter  

# Client Connection to PostgreSQL / Database Commands  
  The following will explain how to connect to the remote database and issue database commands.  
  The following commands will be issued at the Terminal  
  1. Determine connection string  
     ```heroku config```  
     Copy the connection string value stored in CRUNCHY_DATABASE_URL
  2. Connect to the database with the PostgreSQL client  
     ```psql connection_string (from above```  
     You should see output similar to below:
     ```
     psql (15.0)
     WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)
              8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference
              page "Notes for Windows users" for details.
     SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
     Type "help" for help.

     postgres=#
     ```  
     Notes: 
     - You can create a variable for the database connection string and use it.  
     - Discuss potential change of database url
     - Review connection options in the Cruchy Bridge site.  

 2. See existing tables  
     ```\d```  
     You should see the following:  
     ```
     postgres=# \d
                          List of relations
     Schema |          Name           | Type |       Owner
     --------+-------------------------+------+-------------------
     public | pg_stat_statements      | view | crunchy_superuser
     public | pg_stat_statements_info | view | crunchy_superuser
     (2 rows)
     ```  
     
  3. Create a table:  
     ```
     CREATE TABLE TESTTABLE (
     ID     SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     FNAME  VARCHAR(10),
     LNAME  VARCHAR(15)
     );
     ```  
     You should get a ```CREATE TABLE``` confirmation.
     
  4. See existing tables: ```\d```  
     You should see the following:  
     ```
                             List of relations
      Schema |          Name           |   Type   |       Owner
     --------+-------------------------+----------+-------------------
      public | pg_stat_statements      | view     | crunchy_superuser
      public | pg_stat_statements_info | view     | crunchy_superuser
      public | testtable               | table    | postgres
      public | testtable_id_seq        | sequence | postgres
     (4 rows)
     ```  
     The table and the sequence for the table.
  
  5. Describe TESTTABLE  
     ```\d TESTTABLE```  
     You should see the following:  
     ```
                                            Table "public.testtable"
     Column |         Type          | Collation | Nullable |                Default
     --------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------------------------------------
     id     | integer               |           | not null | nextval('testtable_id_seq'::regclass)
     fname  | character varying(10) |           |          |
     lname  | character varying(10) |           |          |
     Indexes:
        "testtable_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
     ```
  
  6. Script  
     You can issue additional commands at the command line: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, DROP, etc...  
     You can also run a script.  Let's run the following script:  
     ```
     -- Drop table
     DROP TABLE TESTTABLE;
    
     -- Create table
     CREATE TABLE TESTTABLE (
     ID     SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     FNAME  VARCHAR(10),
     LNAME  VARCHAR(15)
     );

     -- Insert data
     INSERT INTO TESTTABLE (FNAME, LNAME) VALUES
     ('Amy', 'Andrews'),
     ('Bob', 'Barns'),
     ('Cindy', 'Chase'),
     ('Dave', 'Dunn');
     ```  
     Create a directory:  **`scripts`**  (e.g.: `e:\scripts` in Windows; `/Users/yourUser/scripts` in Mac/Linux)  
     Create a file in the above directory: **`pgscript.sql`**  
     Run the script as follows:  
     `\i e:/scripts/pgscript.sql`  On Windows, note the forward slashes `/`  
     or  
     `\i /Users/yourUser/scripts/pgscript.sql`  On Mac/Linux
     
     You will see the following:  
     ```
     DROP TABLE
     CREATE TABLE
     INSERT 0 4
     ```  
     
  6. See the records in the table:  
     ```
     SELECT *
     FROM TESTTABLE;
     ```  
     You will see the following:  
     ```
     id | fname |  lname
     ----+-------+---------
       1 | Amy   | Andrews
       2 | Bob   | Barns
       3 | Cindy | Chase
       4 | Dave  | Dunn
     (4 rows)
     ```  
 7. Other  
    Experiment with other SQL commands.
